# Galton Board
Galton Board is basically beads or small balls dropping from the top and bounces either left or right until it falls down to the bottom.

# Galton Board Simulation
I tried to create Galton Board Simulation using java. There are still a lot that can be improved, but for now this is just a basic very simple Galton Board Simulation.

**note:** This code could be wrong. I didn't really check carefully.

# Example Result
          o         
          o         
          o o       
          o o       
      o   o o o     
    0 1 0 5 3 1 0 0

This is a frequency distribution from my Galton Board Simulation. You can run a code adjust some variables and maybe you could see some interesting results.
